        Imagine sinking your fork into layers of tender pasta, each one
        smothered in a rich, slow-simmered tomato sauce that bursts with the
        flavors of ripe tomatoes, garlic, and Italian herbs. Picture the creamy,
        golden mozzarella stretching with every bite, mingling with velvety
        béchamel and savory ground beef that melts in your mouth. The top is
        baked to perfection—crisp, cheesy, and oh-so-satisfying, with a fresh
        basil leaf adding a pop of aroma that makes your senses tingle. This
        isn’t just lasagna—it’s a warm hug on a plate, crafted to comfort and
        delight. Whether it’s a cozy night in or a family gathering, this dish
        brings everyone together with its irresistible, hearty goodness.

      <h3>Steps to Cook Lasagna</h3>
      <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce (Bolognese)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over
          medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the finely chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened
          and translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute until
          fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ground beef (and pork, if using) to the pan. Cook, breaking it
          up with a spoon, until browned and fully cooked (about 6-8 minutes).
          Drain excess fat if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to
          reduce slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried
          basil, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for 30-40
          minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Add chopped fresh
          basil in the last 5 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 2: Prepare the Béchamel Sauce</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk in 1/4 cup of flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to form a roux,
          stirring constantly to avoid burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually pour in the warmed milk while whisking continuously to
          prevent lumps. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring, until the sauce
          thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat and set
          aside.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 3: Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If using pre-cooked noodles, bring a large pot of salted water to a
          boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions
          (usually 8-10 minutes) until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water
          to prevent sticking. Lay them flat on a clean towel or parchment
          paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step and proceed directly
          to assembly.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 4: Preheat the Oven</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 5: Assemble the Lasagna</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Spread a thin layer of meat sauce (about 1/2 cup) on the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a layer of lasagna noodles (about 3-4 noodles, depending on
          size) over the sauce, slightly overlapping if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over the noodles.</li>
        <li>
          Spoon 1/3 of the béchamel sauce over the meat sauce, spreading it
          evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses over the sauces.
          Add dollops of ricotta (if using) for extra creaminess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the layers (noodles, meat sauce, béchamel, cheeses) two more
          times, ending with a final layer of noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top the final noodle layer with the remaining béchamel sauce, a
          generous layer of mozzarella, and a sprinkle of Parmesan for that
          golden crust.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 6: Bake the Lasagna</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cover the dish with aluminum foil (tent it slightly to avoid sticking
          to the cheese) and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the
          top is bubbly and golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          If desired, broil for 2-3 minutes at the end to get an extra crispy,
          cheesy top (watch closely to avoid burning).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Step 7: Rest and Serve</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes to
          set, making it easier to slice.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves for a pop of color and flavor.</li>
        <li>
          Cut into squares and serve warm, perhaps with a side of garlic bread
          or a green salad.
        </li>
      </ol>
