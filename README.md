I'll use all the HTML knowledge I learned since the start of my TOP's learning, like:

- Creating a Git repo;
- Using command line interface;
- How and when to commit;
- create a html file;
- write the html's boilerplate;
- write basic tags for html code'structure (h1, p, a, img, etc.)

I improve the website now with some style thanks to CSS code.
