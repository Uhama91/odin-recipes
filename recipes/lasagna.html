    <p>Imagine sinking your fork into layers of tender pasta, each one smothered in a rich, slow-simmered tomato sauce that bursts with the flavors of ripe tomatoes, garlic, and Italian herbs. Picture the creamy, golden mozzarella stretching with every bite, mingling with velvety béchamel and savory ground beef that melts in your mouth. The top is baked to perfection—crisp, cheesy, and oh-so-satisfying, with a fresh basil leaf adding a pop of aroma that makes your senses tingle.
    This isn’t just lasagna—it’s a warm hug on a plate, crafted to comfort and delight. Whether it’s a cozy night in or a family gathering, this dish brings everyone together with its irresistible, hearty goodness.</p>
